# Discogs dataset

This dataset is taken from [Discogs monthly dump](http://data.discogs.com/).

It is not part of this repository and you need to pull it manually by using the `./pull.sh` CLI command.
By default, it will get `20220101` dataset, but you can choose your own dataset by suffixing it to the CLI command.
For example `./pull.sh 20210901` will get September 2021 dump.
